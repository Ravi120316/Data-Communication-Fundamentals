## 🔑 What is Data Communication?
**Data Communication** refers to the exchange of data between two devices through a transmission medium such as wire, fiber optics, or wireless channels.  
For effective communication, the following five components are required:
1. **Message** → The information to be communicated.  
2. **Sender** → The device that sends the message.  
3. **Receiver** → The device that receives the message.  
4. **Transmission Medium** → The physical path (wired/wireless).  
5. **Protocol** → A set of rules governing communication.
