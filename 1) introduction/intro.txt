# Introduction to Data Communication

**Data Communication** refers to the process of exchanging data between two or more devices through a transmission medium (wired or wireless).  
The data can be in the form of text, audio, video, images, or files.  

The primary goal of data communication is to deliver data:
- To the correct destination
- In the correct format
- At the correct time

## Components of Data Communication

1. **Sender (Source)**  
   - The device that sends the data (e.g., computer, mobile).  

2. **Receiver (Destination)**  
   - The device that receives the data.  

3. **Message (Data)**  
   - The actual information to be communicated.  

4. **Medium (Transmission Channel)**  
   - The physical or wireless path through which data travels (e.g., cables, fiber optics, radio waves).  

5. **Protocol**  
   - A set of rules that governs communication between devices (e.g., TCP/IP).

## Importance of Data Communication

- Forms the foundation of computer networks.  
- Enables resource sharing, global connectivity, and instant communication.  
- Essential for applications like Internet browsing, banking, social media, and business systems.
